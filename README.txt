==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:

a tidy data set as described below;
a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; and
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Objectives

run_analysis.R performs the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

run.analysis.R
=======
1. It loads the train and test data sets and uses rbind to merge the two datasets into one data frame.
2. grep is used to extract the mean and standard deviation are extracted from the features data set.
3. It cleans the column names and then applies this to the x data frame.
4. It loads the activities data set and converts it to lower case using tolower and removes underscore using gsub. activity and subject column names are named for y and subj data sets, respectively.
5. The three data sets, x, y and subject, are merged. It exports these as a txt file into the UCI-HAR folder in the same working directory, named merged.txt.
6. The mean of activities and subjects are created into a separate tidy data set which is exported into the UCI-HAR folder as txt file; this is named tidyData.txt.


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
